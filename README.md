# EmbeddedWeatherStation

## Description

#### This weather station was a idea I had, I thought it would be challenging to make, and get all the code for the different sensors all working together. But it worked and everything seems to read correctly. 
- It includes a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor, a SPL06/BME pressure sensor which also measures temperature and a GPS Neo 6m sensor and an LCD screen
- an Arduino Uno and a breadboard with 21 wires conntecting it all up.
